## Free theme for Ghost

Hello, I created this theme for Ghost with inspiration from [Medium](https://medium.com/).
It is available for free so you can use on your site. It is strictly forbidden to use it for commercial use. If you have any suggestions to improve the theme,  you can send me a tweet [@GodoFredoNinja](https://goo.gl/y3aivK)

## Web Browser Support for Simply

Simply supports the following web [browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox).

## Theme development

Simply uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) as a build tool and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage front-end packages.

### Font Icons

Icons generated by [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select) and import  `src/fonts/selection.json`

### Install dependencies

From the command line on your host machine (not on your Vagrant development box), navigate to the theme directory then run `yarn`:

```shell
# @ themes/simply
$ yarn
```

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Build commands

- `yarn run start` — Compile assets when file changes are made, start Browsersync session
- `yarn run build` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
- `yarn run build:production` — Compile assets for production

#### Additional commands

- `yarn run rmassets` — Remove your `assets/` folder
- `yarn run lint` — Run eslint against your assets and build scripts

### Using Browsersync

To use Browsersync you need to update `devUrl` at the bottom of `src/config.json` to reflect your local development hostname.

If your local development URL is `https://project-name.dev`, update the file to read:

```json
...
  "devUrl": "https://project-name.dev",
...
```

By default, Browsersync will use webpack's [HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html), which won't trigger a page reload in your browser.

If you would like to force Browsersync to reload the page whenever certain file types are edited, then add them to `watch` in `src/config.json`.

```json
...
  "watch": [
    "**/*.hbs"
  ],
...
```
