## Simply Support for Web Browsers
Mapache supports the following web [browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=flexbox)

### Replace Favorite Icon
Create an image icon with these dimensions with the name icon.png `192px * 192px` in Copy your new favorite icon to `./assets/images/icon.png`

## Theme development

Simply uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) as a build tool and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage front-end packages.

### Font Icons
Icons generated by [Icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select) and import  `src/fonts/selection.json`

### Install dependencies

From the command line on your host machine (not on your Vagrant development box), navigate to the theme directory then run `yarn`:

```shell
# @ themes/simply
$ yarn
```

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Build commands

* `yarn run start` — Compile assets when file changes are made, start Browsersync session
* `yarn run build` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `yarn run build:production` — Compile assets for production

#### Additional commands

* `yarn run rmassets` — Remove your `assets/` folder
* `yarn run lint` — Run eslint against your assets and build scripts

### Using Browsersync

To use Browsersync you need to update `devUrl` at the bottom of `src/config.json` to reflect your local development hostname.

If your local development URL is `https://project-name.dev`, update the file to read:
```json
...
  "devUrl": "https://project-name.dev",
...
```

By default, Browsersync will use webpack's [HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html), which won't trigger a page reload in your browser.

If you would like to force Browsersync to reload the page whenever certain file types are edited, then add them to `watch` in `src/config.json`.

```json
...
  "watch": [
    "**/*.hbs"
  ],
...
```
